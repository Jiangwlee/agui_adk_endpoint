# AG-UI ADK Endpoint

[AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/integrations/adk-middleware/python/src/ag_ui_adk/) has realeased a ADK middleware for python. But it does not fullfill Google ADK's core features. Some functionality like ADK plugin is not supported.

I start this project to add some missing features. It could be used as a fundamental ADK middleware for your project.
